# ADR XXXX: Title (Short Imperative)

Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Status: Proposed
Supersedes: (optional ADR number) 
Superseded-By: (leave blank until another ADR replaces this)

## Context
Describe the forces at play: requirements, constraints, quality attributes, risks, scale expectations. Provide just enough background so the decision is understandable by someone new in 6 months.

## Decision
The decision in a concise, affirmative sentence.

## Rationale
- Bullet points explaining why this option was chosen over others.
- Reference benchmarks, prior incidents, costs, or complexity trade-offs.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

### Negative / Mitigations
- Downside 1 (mitigation?)
- Downside 2 (mitigation?)

## Alternatives Considered
| Option | Pros | Cons | Why Not Chosen |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| A | ... | ... | ... |
| B | ... | ... | ... |

## Decision Criteria (If Helpful)
List explicit criteria (e.g., latency, cost, maintainability) and how the decision scores.

## Implementation Notes
High-level tasks / sequence to enact the decision (not a full project plan):
1. ...
2. ...

## Follow-Up Actions
- Action with owner (if known)
- Metrics or triggers that would cause re-evaluation

## Revisit Triggers
Conditions under which this ADR should be reconsidered (e.g., >10^7 vectors, latency > P95 target, vendor pricing change).
