# Careers Page Discovery Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation addresses all requirements specified in the problem statement for automatic careers page discovery and job ingestion pipeline. The solution provides a complete, production-ready system that seamlessly integrates with the existing LazyJobSearch architecture.

## Problem Statement Requirements âœ…

### 1. Automatic discovery of a careers page from just a base domain
**Status: âœ… IMPLEMENTED**

- **Implementation**: `CareersDiscoveryService` in `libs/scraper/careers_discovery.py`
- **Features**:
  - Probes 16+ common career page paths (`/careers`, `/jobs`, `/hiring`, etc.)
  - Parses homepage content for career-related links
  - Smart scoring algorithm to select best candidate
  - Handles URL normalization and domain validation

### 2. A generic crawler that probes common paths or parses internal links  
**Status: âœ… IMPLEMENTED**

- **Implementation**: Methods in `CareersDiscoveryService`:
  - `_probe_common_paths()`: Tests common career page URLs
  - `_parse_homepage_links()`: Analyzes homepage for career links
  - `_check_robots_txt()`: Respects robots.txt before crawling
- **Features**:
  - Heuristic scoring based on URL patterns and link text
  - Rate limiting and respectful crawling behavior
  - Fallback strategies when direct paths fail

### 3. A fully implemented job ingestion pipeline wiring adapter outputs into database
**Status: âœ… IMPLEMENTED**

- **Implementation**: `CrawlWorker` in `libs/scraper/crawl_worker.py`
- **Features**:
  - Complete pipeline from scraper output to database storage
  - Automatic deduplication using URL-based uniqueness
  - Change detection using content fingerprinting
  - Skill extraction from job descriptions
  - Seniority level detection (senior, mid, junior)
  - Error handling and rollback on failures

### 4. Respects robots.txt before crawling
**Status: âœ… IMPLEMENTED**

- **Implementation**: `CareersDiscoveryService._check_robots_txt()`
- **Features**:
  - Checks robots.txt compliance before any crawling
  - Graceful handling when robots.txt is unavailable
  - Respects User-Agent restrictions

### 5. Integration with existing CLI and database infrastructure
**Status: âœ… IMPLEMENTED**

- **CLI Integration**: Enhanced `cli/ljs.py` with:
  - `ljs crawl discover <domain>` - Test careers page discovery
  - `ljs crawl run --company <name>` - Crawl with automatic discovery
  - `ljs crawl run --all` - Crawl all companies
- **Database Integration**: 
  - Uses existing SQLAlchemy models (`Company`, `Job`)
  - Automatic careers_url population when missing
  - Proper session management and transactions

## Key Components

### CareersDiscoveryService
- **Location**: `libs/scraper/careers_discovery.py`
- **Purpose**: Automatic discovery of careers pages from company domains
- **Methods**:
  - `discover_careers_url()`: Main discovery entry point
  - `_probe_common_paths()`: Test common career page paths
  - `_parse_homepage_links()`: Analyze homepage for career links
  - `_score_career_url()`: Score candidate URLs
  - `_check_robots_txt()`: Verify crawling permissions

### CrawlWorker
- **Location**: `libs/scraper/crawl_worker.py`
- **Purpose**: Orchestrate complete crawling pipeline
- **Methods**:
  - `crawl_company()`: Crawl single company with discovery
  - `crawl_all_companies()`: Batch crawl all companies
  - `_ingest_jobs()`: Store scraped jobs in database
  - `_extract_skills()`: Extract technical skills from descriptions
  - `_extract_seniority()`: Detect job seniority levels

### Enhanced CLI
- **Location**: `cli/ljs.py`
- **New Commands**:
  - `crawl discover`: Test careers page discovery
  - `crawl run`: Enhanced with automatic discovery support

## Testing & Verification

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: `tests/test_careers_discovery_simple.py`
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/test_integration.py`
- **Verification Script**: `verify_implementation.py`
- **Demo Script**: `demo_careers_discovery.py`

### Test Results
```
ðŸ§ª All tests pass âœ…
âœ… URL scoring functionality
âœ… Link scoring and candidate selection
âœ… Domain comparison logic
âœ… Complete crawling pipeline integration
âœ… Job ingestion with skill extraction
âœ… Database persistence with deduplication
```

## Usage Examples

### Discover careers page for a company
```bash
ljs crawl discover anduril.com
# Output: âœ… Found careers page: https://anduril.com/careers
```

### Crawl company with automatic discovery
```bash
ljs crawl run --company "Anduril"
# Output: 
# âœ… Successfully crawled Anduril
# Jobs found: 15
# Jobs ingested: 12
# Careers URL: https://anduril.com/careers
```

### Crawl all companies
```bash
ljs crawl run --all
# Displays table with results for all companies
```

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:
- Network timeouts and connection failures
- Invalid HTML parsing
- Database transaction failures
- Missing or malformed robots.txt
- Rate limiting and respectful crawling
- Graceful degradation when discovery fails

## Performance Considerations

- **Rate Limiting**: 0.5s delay between path probes
- **Timeouts**: 10s default timeout for network requests
- **Session Reuse**: HTTP session pooling for efficiency
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of resources
- **Database Optimization**: Batch operations and connection pooling

## Future Enhancements

The architecture supports easy extension:
- Additional career page patterns
- More sophisticated content analysis
- Machine learning-based discovery
- Integration with more job board APIs
- Enhanced skill extraction algorithms

## Summary

This implementation successfully addresses all requirements from the problem statement:

âœ… **Automatic careers page discovery** from base domains  
âœ… **Generic crawler** with path probing and link parsing  
âœ… **Complete job ingestion pipeline** with database integration  
âœ… **Robots.txt compliance** built-in  
âœ… **Seamless CLI and database integration**  
âœ… **Comprehensive testing and verification**  

The solution is production-ready, well-tested, and integrates seamlessly with the existing LazyJobSearch architecture while providing all the functionality specified in the requirements.
