# LazyJobSearch MVP Implementation

This document details the implemented components of the LazyJobSearch system, based on the architecture specifications in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## üèóÔ∏è Implemented Components

### 1. Database Layer (`libs/db/`)

**Enhanced SQLAlchemy Models with pgvector Support:**
- Complete schema with vector embeddings (1536-dim for OpenAI text-embedding-3-large)
- Full-text search support with PostgreSQL TSVECTOR
- Comprehensive relationships and indexes for performance
- Support for resume chunking, job description processing, and match scoring

**Key Models:**
- `Company`: Job posting sources with scraper configuration
- `Job` & `JobChunk`: Job descriptions with semantic chunks and embeddings
- `Resume` & `ResumeChunk`: Resume content with section-aware chunking
- `Match`: Job-resume scoring results with LLM reasoning

### 2. NLP & Text Processing (`libs/nlp/`)

**Semantic Chunking System:**
- Document structure awareness (resume sections vs JD requirements)
- Configurable chunk sizes with sentence boundary detection
- Section-specific processing for optimal embedding quality

**Skill Extraction Engine:**
- Curated skill dictionaries (5 categories: programming, frameworks, databases, cloud, tools)
- Pattern matching with confidence scoring
- Context-aware skill validation and categorization

**Experience Calculator:**
- Multi-pattern regex for years of experience extraction
- Education bonus system (PhD +4 years, Master's +2 years)
- Date range parsing from employment history

### 3. Embedding Services (`libs/embed/`)

**OpenAI Integration:**
- text-embedding-3-large provider (1536 dimensions)
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Cost estimation and token counting
- Abstract provider interface for future model flexibility

### 4. LLM Services (`libs/llm/`)

**Job Matching & Scoring:**
- Structured prompts for consistent LLM evaluation
- 0-100 scoring with action recommendations (apply/skip/maybe)
- Skill gap analysis and detailed reasoning
- Cost tracking and model abstraction

### 5. Resume Processing Pipeline (`apps/resume_ingest/`)

**Complete Ingestion Workflow:**
- PDF and DOCX parsing with structured section extraction
- Semantic chunking preserving document structure
- Skill detection and experience calculation
- Embedding generation and database persistence

**File Format Support:**
- PDF: PyPDF2 with text cleanup and structure detection
- DOCX: python-docx with table extraction
- Text normalization and section identification

### 6. Job Scraping Framework (`apps/scraper/`)

**Selenium-Based Scraping:**
- Anti-detection features with user agent rotation
- Human-like delays and interaction patterns
- robots.txt compliance and politeness controls
- Site-specific adapters for major job boards

**Implemented Adapters:**
- **LinkedIn Jobs**: Search and detail extraction (with anti-bot awareness)
- **Greenhouse**: Company-specific job board scraping
- **Lever**: Alternative ATS platform support

### 7. Docker Development Environment (`deploy/docker/`)

**Complete Stack:**
- PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector extension
- Redis for task queuing
- MinIO for object storage (compressed JDs, resume files)
- Separate containers for scraper, processors, and API

## üîß Technical Specifications

### Algorithms Implemented

**1. Semantic Text Chunking**
```python
# Preserves document structure with configurable sizes
chunker = SemanticChunker(target_chunk_size=400, max_chunk_size=800)
chunks = chunker.chunk_text(text, metadata={'doc_type': 'resume'})
```

**2. Skill Extraction with Confidence Scoring**
```python
# Context-aware skill matching with categorization
extractor = SkillExtractor()
skills = extractor.extract_skills(text, min_confidence=0.7)
```

**3. Experience Calculation with Education Bonus**
```python
# Multi-source experience calculation
experience = extractor.extract_experience(resume_text)
# Returns: raw_experience, education_bonus, total_experience
```

**4. Vector Similarity with PyTorch**
```python
# Efficient similarity computation
similarities = torch.nn.functional.cosine_similarity(
    resume_embeddings, job_embeddings, dim=-1
)
```

### Performance Optimizations

- **Batch Embedding**: Process multiple texts simultaneously
- **IVFFlat Indexing**: Fast vector similarity search in PostgreSQL
- **Chunking Strategy**: Preserve semantic meaning while staying under token limits
- **Caching**: Reuse embeddings for identical content
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful scraping with configurable delays

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- OpenAI API key

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and set up environment
cd LazyJobSearch
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OpenAI API key

# Start the stack
cd deploy/docker
docker-compose up -d

# Run database migrations
docker-compose exec api alembic upgrade head

# Test the components
python -m pytest tests/test_pytorch_integration.py
```

### Basic Usage

**Process a Resume:**
```python
from apps.resume_ingest import ResumeProcessor
from pathlib import Path

processor = ResumeProcessor()
result = processor.process_resume_file(Path("resume.pdf"))
print(f"Resume processed: {result['resume_id']}")
```

**Scrape Jobs:**
```python
from apps.scraper import GreenhouseAdapter

scraper = GreenhouseAdapter("stripe")
result = scraper.search_jobs(["python", "backend", "api"])
print(f"Found {len(result.jobs)} jobs")
```

**Generate Embeddings:**
```python
from libs.embed import OpenAIEmbeddingProvider

provider = OpenAIEmbeddingProvider()
embedding = provider.embed_text("Senior Python developer with Django experience")
print(f"Embedding dimension: {embedding.shape[0]}")
```

## üß™ Testing

The system includes comprehensive tests validating:
- PyTorch integration and vector operations
- Text chunking and semantic preservation
- Skill extraction accuracy
- Experience calculation logic
- Embedding provider functionality

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific component tests
python -m pytest tests/test_pytorch_integration.py -v
```

## üìä Architecture Decisions

### Why PyTorch?
- Efficient tensor operations for vector similarity
- Future extensibility for custom ML models
- Excellent integration with embedding workflows
- CPU inference capabilities without GPU requirements

### Why OpenAI Embeddings?
- High-quality semantic representations out of the box
- Stable API with predictable costs
- 1536-dimensional vectors balance quality and storage
- Provider abstraction allows future model switching

### Why Semantic Chunking?
- Preserves document structure and context
- Optimizes for embedding quality over raw size
- Section-aware processing for resumes and job descriptions
- Better match quality through preserved semantic boundaries

### Why PostgreSQL + pgvector?
- Single database for both structured and vector data
- Excellent performance with proper indexing
- Mature ecosystem and operational tools
- No need for separate vector database in MVP

## üîÑ Next Steps

### Planned Extensions
- [ ] Complete job description processing pipeline
- [ ] Vector similarity matching service  
- [ ] Cover letter generation
- [ ] Application automation with Greenhouse/Lever APIs
- [ ] Web interface for resume management
- [ ] Advanced ML models for match scoring

### Scaling Considerations
- Horizontal scaling via microservices architecture
- Advanced vector indexing (HNSW, IVF with clustering)
- Distributed task processing with Celery
- Caching layers for frequent queries
- Model fine-tuning for domain-specific matching
